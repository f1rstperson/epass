* Epass

Epass is a password-manager based on =pass= (see https://www.passwordstore.org/). The main
advantage over other solutions is that *the only external dependency is* =gpg=, not =pass=
itself. As a result, it runs very well on all platforms, including Windows. It includes
clipboard-management and a major-mode that can display the password as asterisks('*'). It
uses the default emacs mechanisms for encryption and decryption of files. _It is still very
much an alpha release_, but it should be stable enough.
